 **`Problem Statement`** :

Hate speech on Twitter has become a widespread issue that undermines the safety and well-being of individuals and communities. It creates a hostile online environment and spreads harmful messages that attack individuals based on their race, ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, and other personal characteristics. The spread of hate speech on Twitter has negative consequences for both the targeted individuals and society as a whole. It is crucial to address this problem and develop effective solutions to prevent the spread of hate speech and promote a safer and more inclusive online environment.

The problem of hate speech on Twitter is not only a moral and ethical issue, but also a legal one. Many countries have laws and regulations in place that prohibit hate speech, but these laws are difficult to enforce in the online world. Despite efforts by Twitter to remove hate speech and promote a respectful environment, the platform is still used as a tool for spreading hate and intolerance. This has resulted in a proliferation of harmful messages that can cause real-world harm to individuals and communities. It is essential to find effective solutions to this problem to ensure that Twitter and other social media platforms are not used to spread hate speech and other forms of online harassment. This requires a combination of technical solutions, community-led efforts, and effective enforcement of existing laws and regulations.

**`Defining Hate Speech`** :

Hate speech on Twitter refers to any form of communication that attacks, threatens, or insults a person or group of people based on their race, religion, ethnicity, national origin, sexual orientation, gender, or any other characteristic that is considered a personal characteristic. This type of speech is not protected by freedom of speech laws and is considered harmful and offensive. Hate speech on Twitter can take the form of direct personal attacks, slurs, and the spread of false information or conspiracy theories aimed at promoting hatred or discrimination against a particular group of people. It creates a hostile and divisive online environment and can lead to real-world harm. Twitter and other social media platforms have a responsibility to address hate speech and ensure a safe and inclusive online environment for all users.

**`Solution`** :

Hate speech on social media platforms, such as Twitter, is a growing concern that needs to be addressed. The solution to this problem is to implement a machine learning model that can accurately identify and classify tweets as hate speech or not. This GitHub repository provides a transfer learning-based machine learning model for the purpose of identifying hate speech on Twitter.

The model is built on the "`nnlm-en-dim50`" token-based text embedding, which has been trained on the English Google News 7B corpus. This pre-trained text embedding provides a robust foundation for the model to extract meaningful features from the tweets and accurately identify hate speech.

The model utilizes advanced NLP techniques to classify tweets based on their language and content. The code for the model is written in Python and makes use of popular libraries such as Tensorflow and Keras. These libraries allow for the implementation of deep learning techniques and ensure efficient training and deployment of the model.

The ultimate goal of this repository is to provide a solution for detecting and preventing hate speech on social media platforms. Providing a machine learning model that can accurately identify hate speech, promotes a safer and more inclusive online environment. This solution can be used by social media platforms, researchers, and organizations working to address the issue of hate speech on the internet.

In conclusion, this Github repository provides a comprehensive solution for identifying hate speech on Twitter using a transfer learning-based machine learning model. The pre-trained text embedding, advanced NLP techniques, and the use of popular deep-learning libraries make it a robust and effective solution for promoting a safer and more inclusive online environment.
